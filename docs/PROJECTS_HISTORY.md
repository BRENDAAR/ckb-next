# Project's History

Some flashbacks of how this was created.

#### What happened to the original [ckb](https://github.com/ccMSC/ckb)?

We don't know. The author of the ckb and most of the parts of ckb-next, [ccMSC](https://github.com/ccMSC), suddenly disappeared and hasn't showed up since July 2016. So the community around the ckb decided to take the project over and continue its development. That's the whole story.

P.S. We hope you're okay, ccMSC.


#### Why ckb-next?

Why? [Because we have democracy, that's why.](https://github.com/mattanger/ckb-next/issues/6)
